#Some steps for refactoring

- fix permissions (why on earth is /var/sylspace world read/writable)?
- move the helper scripts to Mojo commands
- make subdomain into a helper
  - it is icky to use typeglobs. ICKY!

#How will we improve this app?

Okay, I've done the page split now, let's just fix up the test
suite anyways.

Okay, all test are now passing, but many are flaky and
interdependent. Oh well for now. So I think we're gonna move all
of the logic for setting up users and stuff into a module, and
have that be shared.

Then we can rewrite those tests to instead be scripts, and as such
they'll be isolated and kosher tests while still doing what
they're supposed to.
