#Some steps for refactoring

- fix permissions (why on earth is /var/sylspace world read/writable)?
- move the helper scripts to Mojo commands
- make subdomain into a helper
  - it is icky to use typeglobs. ICKY!
- move all file manip to using Mojo::File (more portable and
  prettier)

#In terms of splitting the page

Okay, we're at a point where we can ALMOST write a test. We need
to move some of the functionality from mksite into a module, and
then use that in the tests. We can use a begin block to give each
test its own special place to make a filesystem. Hooray!

I wanna get Grades.t passing, and then we'll proceed.
