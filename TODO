#Some steps for refactoring

- make running the server not need root
  - let's start by UN-hardcoding /var/syslspace
- fix permissions (why on earth is /var/sylspace world read/writable)?
- make the model location configurable
- move the helper scripts to Mojo commands
- get rid of the domainport thing. Make it a helper instead
  - ditto for subdomain
- move all file manip to using Mojo::File (more portable and
  prettier)
- oh dear bob, we need to fix up this hardcoding so that we can
  actually make a docker image
- change testing to use lvh.me, which always resolves to localhost
  - oh goodness, I can't b/c it expects only one subdomain.
    durrr-hay
    - works fine if we limit it to lvh.me alone w/ no subdomain.
      Remove this feature anyways
- also, it's hardcoded to work on port 80. That's bad

#In terms of splitting the page

I want to move the logic out of that template and into the code
(that makes it accessible to tests, too!). Then we can go forward
and make some tests to establish a baseline, and then splitting
the page is trivial.

#Getting this up in a testing env

We need to clean some more stuff up b4 we can actually use the
docker image
