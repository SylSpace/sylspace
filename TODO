#issues to figure out
currently, we want to solve the issue we're having with
sub-sub-domains. We basically want to change all dots into dashes.
The only problem is that some courses have dashes in them, and
then that changes how we're currently displaying the output on the
course list.

Question: do we actually care? Maybe we'll just give the
instructors the ability to make a display name for their course?
It sholdn't be the biggest deal...

#what we're doing
1- okay, we have redirector in place, it rewrites the urls to
permanently redirect to https
