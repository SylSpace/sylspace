#Some steps for refactoring

- make running the server not need root
  - let's start by UN-hardcoding /var/syslspace
- fix permissions (why on earth is /var/sylspace world read/writable)?
- make the model location configurable
- move the helper scripts to Mojo commands
- get rid of the domainport thing. Make it a helper instead
  - ditto for subdomain
- move all file manip to using Mojo::File (more portable and
  prettier)

#In terms of splitting the page

I want to move the logic out of that template and into the code
(that makes it accessible to tests, too!). Then we can go forward
and make some tests to establish a baseline, and then splitting
the page is trivial.
