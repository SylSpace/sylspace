okay, we explicitly need the domainname, but let's make it more sane

variables that must be destroyed:
  - $ENV{SYLSPACE_siteip}
    - this one is used for the magic-token thing only
  - $ENV{SYLSPACE_onlocalhost}
    - this can just be replaced with a check against development mode
  - $ENV{SYLSPACE_(site|jumbo).color} 
    - i wanna make this into a hash for better usage
  - $ENV{SYLSPACE_haveoauth}
    - defs a better way to check this

helpers to refactor out:
  - domainport
    - it's too gaas, we should just provide an interface to make a
      link to a subodmain or whatever

any mention of domainname
